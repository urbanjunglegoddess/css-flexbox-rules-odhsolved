# Flexbox RULES

## Introduction

In this activity, you'll be designing the sign-in and sign-up forms to replicate the Authentication page mockup. After that, you'll be enhancing the styles of the stylish e-commerce page that displays products in three different views.

These tasks will turn you into a Flexbox expert! You'll gain the ability to construct about 95% of the layouts needed on various freelance platforms. This exercise promises to be a highly enjoyable way to refine your Flexbox skills!

Check out the pages images you'll be imitating:

- Authentication page: /assets/images/authentication-page-solved.png
- E-commerce page:
